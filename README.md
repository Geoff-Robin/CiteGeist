## [+] Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Think of it as the Sherlock Holmes of articles‚Äîminus the deerstalker hat. It finds the best content by analyzing what‚Äôs written, no detective work required. üîç
- **Article Ranking**: It sorts articles like a lazy librarian who only cares about putting the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones on display. The top picks get the VIP treatment, while the rest‚Ä¶ well, they get a polite nod.
- **Text Analysis**: This feature scans through the text with the enthusiasm of someone who‚Äôs had too much coffee and nothing else to do. It picks up keywords and context without breaking a sweat.
- **No User Tracking**: Rest easy knowing that your reading habits remain as mysterious as my motivation. CiteGeist focuses on the content, not on spying on you.
